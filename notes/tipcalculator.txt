1) Android apps have four types of executable components - activities,services,content providers
   and broadcast receivers.
2) In this app we will discuss about activities which are defined as subclasses of Activity
   (package android.app).An app can have many activities, one of which is the first you see after launching the
   app. You interact with Activity through views - GUI components that inherit from class View (package android.view).
3) An activity can manage multiple Fragments. On a phone, each Fragment typically occupies the entire screen and the
   Activity switches between fragments based on user interactions. On a tablet, activities typically display multiple
   fragments per screen to take advantage of the larger screen size.
